      <description>This version is built with Go 1.21.1 which contains some relevant security fixes for the html/template package, see Issue 62196 and Issue 62197. This is the main reason Hugo 0.119.0 is released sooner rather than later. But this release also comes with a dependency refresh and some useful image processing improvements:&#xA;A new general-purpose Process method and filter. A new Opacity filter.&#xA;Release Notes on GitHub.</description>
